Genetic Algorithm Playground - TSP

I decided to experiment with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/),
and this was my first quick project.

## :star: Features

Tinker with a GA approach to finding optimal solutions for the famous [Traveling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem), and watch as it works.

You can experiment with the *population size* of each generation, *number of cities*, and the *mutation rate*, and see how performance is affected on the graph.

## :running: Quick Start

Just download the files into a directory and open `index.html` in your browser.
This is all client-side Javascript, so there's nothing to install.
